# Makers Week 1 - Weekend Challenge - Airport

## This project is a coding challenge in Ruby using test driven development.

It should control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.

This codebase will be tested using Rspec.
